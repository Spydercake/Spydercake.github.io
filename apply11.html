	<main>
		<p> What we consider credit is really just a history of succesful (and unsuccesful)
		
		transaction that we make in our lives. With this in mind it generally makes sense
		
		that in order to build a good credit score, one will need to build a history of 
		
		good transcations. The following list is what I would recommend someone do if they
		
		wish to build a good credit score.
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Make your payments on time. Bills sent to collections are terrible for your credit history.</li>
			
			<li>Two, keep the amount of accounts and the credit utilization on those accounts, low.
			You want to show a history of smart credit utilization, not a history of large amounts of utilization.</li>
			
			<li>Three, keep accounts open for as long as possible. Pay them off but leave them open to show
			a history.</li>
		</ul>
